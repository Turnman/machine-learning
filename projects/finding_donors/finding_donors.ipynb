    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "* I will base my argumentation on the results of the F0.5-scores which I computed for all three models. The F0.5-score puts a higher focus on the precision score since we want to minimize the wrongly predicted labels. These are individuals which are said to earn more than 50K but actually earn at most 50K. Even though the Decision Tree classifier scores almost a 100% on a subset of the training data, it still loses a lot of its score when being applied to the testing set. The good performance on the training set as well as the poor performance on the testing set might lead to the suspicion that the classifier is overfitting. Therefore, I would suggest dropping further investigation with this classifier. Also, I would drop the Naive Bayes classifier without further argumentation since it is by far the poorest classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I would recommend using the support vector machine for further analysis since it achieves good and constant scores between the different sizes of training data as well as similar results between training and testing data.

Support vector machines (SVMs) get their name from the actual support vectors they calculate when trying to split the data with a hyperplane. SVMs basically try to split the beneath data set by inserting a hyperplane between the different data points while maximizing the margin, which is the distance between the closest data points with different labels. The bigger the margin, the better the classifier since it leaves more space to other categories and therefore minimizes the risk to misclassify a new data point which might be even closer to the other class than any on the existing data points. \n",
    "* In some instances, we might not be able to pull a linear hyperplane through the data which would make the use of a SVM impossible. To conquer this difficulty, we make use of the vector-characteristic and increase the dimensionality of the data we have. The dimensionality is usually determined by the number of features we use to make predictions. If we would use age, sportiness and weight to determine the condition on someone’s bones, we'd have three dimensions. In case we cannot differentiate between the different labels, we can increase to a fourth dimension where we could lift the data to, in hope to be able to insert a linear hyperplane (or hyperplanes) to classify the labels accordingly. In case on extra dimension wasn't enough, we can keep increasing the number of dimensions until we might be even putting every data point in an extra dimension. This would lead to overfitting and we don't won't this but demonstrates how we can adapt a SVM to our data. \n",
    "* The big benefit of the SVM is ability to easily work high dimensional input data as well its efficiency since it only uses a subset of the data to construct the boundary - the closest data points of different classes to each other. On the other hand, SVMs tend to overfit very fast if no maximum number of dimension is set as I described earlier."

    "Actually, the results from the optimized model aren't significantly better then, the result of the optimized model. In my opinion, a F-score of 67.78% leads to either one of two conclusions. Either it is just really hard to make predictions on the beneath data because of noise, missing values etc. or the model is not good enough and needs more 'tuning'. Here the second statement should be the case. The best model configuration had a medium low gamma but the highest C which leads to the assumption that I'd need to increase the C value by a lot and may try a more gamma values very close to the current one. \n",

    "* Number 1: Education-level. I would rank the education level the highest since prior education enables people for specific jobs. Also, it is statistically proven that poorer education leads to poverty in many cases.\n",
    "* Number 2: Age. a teenager most probably won't earn 50K a year but an adult in his/her 50s might will. In combination with the age the education-level will be even more informative.\n",
    "* Number 3: Hours per week. I choose hours per week since high payed jobs also demand long work days since these people usually have a higher responsibility in their organisation and are compensated with a higher loan for that.\n",
    "* Number 4: Work class. As far as I know the private sector is not as much regulated as the public sector is and therefore it is easier to get paid better since the market regulates it somehow self. Also, a self-employed person might have to earn more than the 50K to be able to pay all the bills etc. where the employer might pay a share.\n",
    "* Number 5: Occupation. Combined with all the other features the occupation helps a lot to determine the loan. Having the sector, we can estimate, if it is one that runs good or not. Also with the education-level, age and hours per week we can estimate the position of such a person in that sector. Combining all this I think it should be possible to predict the loan more precise."

    "Even though the ranking includes three of my features, they are also, except for the age, misplaced. Concerning the martial status, I might guess that the people are more likely to get married to someone who is paid well (even though you could argue the actual opposite). Since the age is in both, mine and the received ranking, second, this would support my hypothesis that an older person will probably also earn more. Third we have the education-num. This is probably the education level as a numerical value and, as I still think, is very important to determine the wage since a better educated person will more likely be in a position with more impact or responsibility and therefore will be paid better. In fourth place, I had the work class instead of the capital gain. Perhaps people with a lot of capital will also have annual capital gains through working capital. Last but not least I guessed that hours per week might be a bit more important than fifth rank but would reason their importance the same as before.  "

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "By using the reduced data, we lost 1% of accuracy and about 2.5% at the F-score. Since we are using less than 50% of the original feature space this is pretty impressive and saved a lot of computational time which was quite noticeable. Here fore I calculated the difference of 126 seconds. <br> I think training time might increase over linear and therefore is always a big factor of the usability of the model. Therefore, I'll definitely will use reduced feature sets in the future to increase the performance of my model."
